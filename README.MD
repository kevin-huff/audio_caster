# Accessing the App from Outside Your Home
Want to share the sound beyond your place?
Here are some tips to help you interface:

**Hosting on Glitch.com**

Glitch.com is a site that's pretty grand,
It hosts Node.js apps, you'll understand.

- Go to Glitch.com, sign up for free,
- Create a new project, as easy as can be.
- Copy your files, or remix with glee,
- Your app's online, for all to see.

**Setting Up Port Forwarding**

If you prefer to host on your own,
Here's how to make your server known:

- Log in to your router, find the port forwarding screen,
- Forward port 3000, keep your IP seen.
- Use your public IP, find it with ease,
- WhatIsMyIP, if you please.
- Share your IP with those you trust,
They can access your app, no need to fuss.

## Project Structure

A simple layout, easy to see,
Here's what each file is meant to be.

- ``server.js``: The server's heart,
Express and Socket.IO play their part.
- ``public/``: The files for the client-side,
With index.html and receiver.html inside.

# server.js

This file sets up the server, nice and quick,
Express and Socket.IO, doing the trick.

# public/index.html

For capturing audio, this page is the key,
With buttons to start and stop, you'll see.

# public/receiver.html

To receive the audio, this page you'll need,
It plays the sound with impressive speed.

## License

This project's free, for all to share,
Under the Unlicense, with love and care.
No lawyers needed, itâ€™s all fun and fair.
For full details, the `LICENSE` file you'll see.
